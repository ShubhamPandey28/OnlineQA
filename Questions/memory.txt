question:Increasing the RAM of a computer typically improves performance because:
options:Virtual memory increases~Larger RAMs are faster~Fewer page faults occur~Fewer segmentation faults occur
answer:2
explanation:When there is more RAM, there would be more mapped virtual pages in physical memory, hence fewer page faults. A page fault causes performance degradation as the page has to be loaded from secondary device.
question:Virtual memory is
options:Large secondary memory~Large main memory~Illusion of large main memory~None of the above
answer:2
explanation:Virtual memory is illusion of large main memory.
question:Page fault occurs when
options:When a requested page is in memory~When a requested page is not in memory~When a page is currupted~When an exception is thrown.
answer:1
explanation:Page fault occurs when a requested page is mapped in virtual address space but not present in memory.
question:Thrashing occurs when
options:When a page fault occurs~Processes on system frequently access pages not memory~Processes on system are in running state~Processes on system are in waiting state.
answer:1
explanation:Thrashing occurs processes on system require more memory than it has. If processes do not have “enough” pages, the pagefault rate is very high. This leads to: – low CPU utilization – operating system spends most of its time swapping to disk The above situation is called thrashing.
